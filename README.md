# SentimentAnalysis

This project was created for the Large Scale Computing on the Cloud class at Johns Hopkins University. The project was a team effort towards
building a small scale proof of concept of an application that would calculate sentiment scores of particular stocks based on News articles pulled using the GoogleNews API.

Eventually we envision the application to be deployed on an AWS cluster. We have done cost analysis and have also compared the would be cost of our application with other solutions on the market. This information is available on the PPT

I give full credit of the Jupyter Notebook to my teammate Mark Tanzer.
